# Final Project
# Project: Secure File Sharing Platform

## Description

This project is a lightweight, secure file-sharing platform that allows users to upload files, optionally protect them with a password, and share download links. It is built with Flask, MongoDB, and supports file metadata handling (e.g., expiration dates, download limits). The system is containerized with Docker for easy deployment.

## Setup and Run Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git https://github.com/software-students-spring2025/5-final-rng.git
cd 5-final-rng
```

### 2. Set up environment variables

You must create a `.env` file at the root of the project. See `.env.example` for an example.

Example `.env`:

```bash
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
FLASK_ENV=development
FLASK_DEBUG=1

MONGO_URI=mongodb://admin:password@localhost:27017/
MONGO_USERNAME=admin
MONGO_PASSWORD=password

MINIO_ROOT_USER=admin
MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=pass1234
MINIO_BUCKET_NAME=file-uploads

MAINTENANCE_API_KEY=your_secure_api_key
```

### 3. Run locally with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Access the service at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Additional Notes

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive variables are loaded through a `.env` file using `python-dotenv`. Example files like `.env.example` are provided for you to set up your environment quickly.
- **Starter Data**: There is no mandatory starter data, but MongoDB collections (`filesharing/uploads`) will be automatically created when you upload the first file.
- **Deployment Tips**: For production, disable Flask debug mode and use services like AWS S3 (instead of MinIO) and Atlas MongoDB.
